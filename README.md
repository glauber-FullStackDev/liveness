# Prova de Vida (Ionic 5) - Fluxo de verificação front-end - LIVENESS

<img src='./src-readme/colagem_principal.png'/>

Proof of life flow, using artificial intelligence for face detection and for controlling the flow itself.

Attached to an AI backend that can detect photos and data in documents and that can determine whether or not an image is a photo of a photo, you can easily create a document masterflow with the ability to determine whether the documents belong to the person and still have a degree of security that prevents photos or videos from being used to approve a registration.

There are services that propose to provide endpoints for analyzing photos and documents.

ONOTE: Only the part of the front-end that applies AI to detect life movements to capture images is included here.
